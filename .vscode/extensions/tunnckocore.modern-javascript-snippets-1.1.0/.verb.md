Highly opinionated to my needs - don't includes snippets that I don't use. But also is mixed between my previous Sublime [javascript-charlike-snippets](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/javascript-charlike-snippets), [standardjs-snippets](https://atom.io/packages/standardjs-snippets) and [es6-javascript](https://atom.io/packages/es6-javascript).

It uses [standard][] style as base. But easily can be changed with a bit automation, so
please open an issue if you want such thing.

The documentation is built and fully automated using [verb][], including [table of contents](#table-of-contents) and even the [snippets docs](#snippets).

## Install
Install with [apm](https://atom.io/packages) _(Atom Editor's package manager)_

```
$ apm install {%= name %}
```

Or launch [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Quick Open (`Ctrl+P`), paste the following command, and press enter.

```
ext install modern-javascript-snippets
```

## Snippets
{%= generateSnippetDocs() %}

{% if (verb.related && verb.related.list && verb.related.list.length) { %}
## Related
{%= related(verb.related.list, {words: 20}) %}
{% } %}

## Contributing
Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue](https://github.com/{%= repository %}/issues/new).
Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for advice on opening issues, pull requests, and coding standards.
If you need some help and can spent some cash, feel free to [contact me at CodeMentor.io](https://www.codementor.io/tunnckocore?utm_source=github&utm_medium=button&utm_term=tunnckocore&utm_campaign=github) too.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Building docs
Documentation and that readme is generated using [verb-generate-readme][], which is a [verb][] generator, so you need to install both of them and then run `verb` command like that

```
$ npm install verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme --global && verb
```

_Please don't edit the README directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in [.verb.md](.verb.md)._

## Running tests
Clone repository and run the following in that cloned directory

```
$ npm install && npm test
```
